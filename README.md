This program is a Demo of JUnit and Maven. It includes a "Gamer" class to store information about a persons name, favorite video game, and number of games they own. Within this class two methods are included to determine if a person is a true gamer and who is a bigger gamer when compairing two people. The methods in this class do not represent my views on what determines someone to be a "true gamer", but are simple methods to use with Unit tests to learn about JUnit and Maven.
